# SortItOut-Sorting_Visualizer

The SortItOut (Sorting Visualizer) is Flutter based Android Application Project. The UI of this project is User-Friendly and it allows the users to visualize the random generated array on different Speeds.

## Sorting Algorithm

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

For example: The below list of characters is sorted in increasing order of their ASCII values. That is, the character with lesser ASCII value will be placed first than the character with higher ASCII value.

	S O R T I T O U T => I O O R S T T T U

<ul>
  <li>Bubble Sort</li>
  <li>Selection Sort</li>
  <li>Insertion Sort</li>
  <li>Shell Sort</li>
  <li>Odd Even Sort etc.</li>
</ul>


### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### Selection Sort

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

### Shell Sort

Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted. The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used.

### Odd-Even Sort

This algorithm is divided into two phases- Odd and Even Phase. The algorithm runs until the array elements are sorted and in each iteration two phases occurs- Odd and Even Phases.
In the odd phase, we perform a bubble sort on odd indexed elements and in the even phase, we perform a bubble sort on even indexed elements.
